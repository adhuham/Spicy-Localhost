# Spicy Localhost
Spice up your localhost index page with a beautiful terminal-like UI

## Install
Just replace 'index.php' with Apache's default 'index.html' file in the server root. It's dead easy!

## Support
Spicy Localhost is intended to use in Apache, PHP and MySQL (LAMP, WAMP, MAMP) environments. It might as well work in an Nginx environment instead of Apache but with few tweaks.
